# Terragon Integration Chain Execution Log
Chain ID: chain_terragon_integration_20250731_132653
Task: Execute 6-phase implementation plan for Terragon integration with hybrid serverless architecture
Status: In Progress

## Original User Request:
Execute the approved 6-phase implementation plan for Terragon integration with hybrid serverless architecture. Begin with Phase 1: Security Remediation.

## Critical Context:
- Existing FastAPI backend has CRITICAL security vulnerabilities
- React TypeScript frontend functional but needs enhancement
- Task system functional but file-based (needs cloud migration)
- WebSocket communication needs SSE migration for serverless
- Security Risk Level: HIGH - Do not deploy in current state

## Agents Selected:
### Phase 1: security-auditor - Available and ready ✓
### Phase 2: cloud-architect - Available and ready ✓
### Phase 3: python-pro - Available and ready ✓
### Phase 4: frontend-developer - Available and ready ✓
### Phase 5: deployment-engineer - Available and ready ✓
### Phase 6: performance-engineer - Available and ready ✓

## Execution Progress:
- [2025-07-31 13:26:53] Chain initialization complete
- [2025-07-31 13:26:53] Phase 1 - security-auditor agent starting...

## Phase 1: Security Remediation & Foundation
**Agent**: security-auditor
**Status**: Starting
**Critical Issues to Address**:
- Authentication system vulnerabilities
- Command injection risks in task execution
- Missing input validation across API endpoints  
- Session management flaws
- Insecure command execution layer

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Security vulnerability assessment report
- Fixed authentication system
- Proper input validation implementation
- Secured command execution layer
- Session management hardening
- API endpoint security review

## Next Phases:
- Phase 2: Cloud Architecture Design (cloud-architect)
- Phase 3: Backend Migration & Integration (python-pro)
- Phase 4: Frontend Enhancement & Migration (frontend-developer)
- Phase 5: Infrastructure & Deployment (deployment-engineer)
- Phase 6: Performance & Quality Assurance (performance-engineer)
