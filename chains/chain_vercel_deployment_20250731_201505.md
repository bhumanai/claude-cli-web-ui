# Chain Execution Log: Vercel Deployment Workflow
Chain ID: chain_vercel_deployment_20250731_201505
Task: Deploy and test Claude CLI Web UI on Vercel with comprehensive validation
Status: In Progress

## Problem Context:
- The deployment itself is working correctly - this is purely an access control limitation
- The deployments are technically working but show a Vercel login page because the Vercel account has authentication requirements enabled
- Need to resolve 401 authentication issues and ensure proper access control

## Agents Selected:
1. **deployment-engineer**: Available and configured - Vercel Configuration Analysis & Optimization
2. **cloud-architect**: Available and configured - Authentication & Access Configuration  
3. **devops-troubleshooter**: Available and configured - Deployment Validation & Debugging
4. **test-automator**: Available and configured - Deployment Testing Strategy
5. **browser-automation-agent**: Available and configured - Live Application Testing

## Execution Progress:
- 20250731_201505 Chain initialized
- 20250731_201505 Starting Phase 1 - deployment-engineer
- 20250731_201520 Phase 1 completed - deployment-engineer analysis ready for checkpoint

## Agent Context Chain:
Each agent will receive outputs from previous agents to avoid duplicate work and build upon previous analysis.

## Phase 1 Results:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Vercel account-level deployment protection causing 401 issues
- **Configuration Analysis**: 3 vercel.json files analyzed, conflicts identified
- **Specific Fixes Provided**: Dashboard settings, configuration optimization, deployment strategy
- **Timeline**: 45-75 minutes estimated resolution
- **Critical Action**: Must access Vercel Dashboard to disable deployment protection

## Final Results:
