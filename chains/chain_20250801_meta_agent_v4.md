Task: Meta-Agent System v4.0 Implementation
Status: In Progress
Timestamp: 2025-08-01

## Agents Selected:
- backend-architect: Available and ready - Design Meta-Agent System v4.0 core architecture
- security-auditor: Available and ready - Security architecture and vulnerability remediation
- ai-engineer: Available and ready - Context Engine and Documentation Library implementation
