### Performance Regression Detection

#### Automated Performance Regression Testing
```python
# Performance Regression Detection
Regression Detection Strategy:
├── Baseline Performance Metrics: Establish performance baselines
├── Continuous Monitoring: Monitor performance in real-time
├── Threshold-based Alerts: Alert on performance degradation
├── Historical Comparison: Compare current vs. historical performance
├── Automated Rollback: Rollback deployments on severe regressions
└── Performance Budgets: Set and enforce performance budgets

Performance Budget Example:
├── API Response Time: < 500ms (95th percentile)
├── Frontend Load Time: < 3 seconds
├── Bundle Size: < 500KB (gzipped)
├── Memory Usage: < 500MB
├── CPU Usage: < 70% sustained
└── Database Query Time: < 100ms average

Regression Alert Thresholds:
├── Critical: > 100% performance degradation
├── High: > 50% performance degradation
├── Medium: > 25% performance degradation
├── Low: > 10% performance degradation
└── Trend: Consistent degradation over time
```
