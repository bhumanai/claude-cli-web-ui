purple_team_conclusion: |
  Green Team wins decisively. Their obsessive optimization resulted in:
  - 9x faster theme switching than Red Team
  - 13x smaller bundle size than Red Team
  - Better real-world performance metrics
  - Adequate security without paranoia
  - Clean, maintainable code
  
  This competition demonstrates that different optimization goals lead to
  vastly different implementations. In this case, performance-first
  development produced the best overall result for end users.
