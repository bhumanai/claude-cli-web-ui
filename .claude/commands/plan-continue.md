# Continue Planning: $ARGUMENTS

I'll create a detailed specification based on your answers to the clarifying questions.

## Phase 3: Generate Detailed Specification

<Task>
  <description>Create comprehensive technical specification</description>
  <prompt>
ORIGINAL TASK: [Insert original task from /plan]

USER ANSWERS TO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS: $ARGUMENTS

PREVIOUS RESEARCH: [Insert research findings from /plan]

Based on the research and user answers, create a comprehensive technical specification:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - What we're building and why
   - Key decisions made based on user input

2. **Technical Architecture**
   - Technology stack and framework choices
   - System architecture and component design
   - Database schema (if applicable)
   - API design (if applicable)

3. **Implementation Plan**
   - Detailed step-by-step breakdown
   - File structure and organization
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Order of implementation

4. **User Experience Design**
   - User flows and interactions
   - Interface requirements
   - Accessibility considerations

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing approach
   - Integration testing plan
   - End-to-end testing scenarios

6. **Security & Performance**
   - Security measures and best practices
   - Performance optimization strategies
   - Scalability considerations

7. **Deployment & Operations**
   - Deployment strategy
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Maintenance considerations

8. **Risk Assessment**
   - Potential challenges and blockers
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Alternative approaches if needed

9. **Success Metrics**
   - How to measure success
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Performance benchmarks

Format this as a detailed specification document that can be handed off for implementation.

</Task>

## Phase 4: Plan Validation & Storage

<Task>
  <description>Validate and store the plan</description>
  <prompt>
GENERATED SPECIFICATION:
[Complete specification from Phase 3 will be inserted here]

Review and validate the specification:
1. Check for completeness and clarity
2. Identify any gaps or inconsistencies
3. Suggest improvements or alternative approaches
4. Create a task folder structure to store this plan
5. Generate a summary for easy reference

Provide a final validated specification ready for execution.

</Task>

## Next Steps

Your detailed plan is now ready! You can:
- Execute it with `/smart-task [plan-name]`
- Reference it manually during implementation
- Modify it based on new requirements
- Use it as a template for similar tasks

The plan has been stored in your tasks folder for future reference.
