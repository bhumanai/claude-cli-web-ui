# Task: Build Agentic Development System

**ID**: task-002-agentic-development-system
**Created**: 2025-01-30 09:45
**Status**: Completed

## Summary
Built a functional slash command system for orchestrating AI agents in development workflows. The system enables commands like /init-project, /start-task, /complete-task, and /test-task to trigger multi-agent workflows.

## Key Achievements
- Discovered and integrated 62 existing agents from `/Users/don/.claude/agents/`
- Created modular Python-based command execution system
- Implemented agent chain orchestration (planner → selector → executor)
- Built interactive CLI with command and agent discovery
- Added comprehensive documentation and usage examples

## Outcomes
1. **Created Agentic Development System** in `/Users/don/D3/agentic/`
   - Command parser that reads slash commands from `.claude/commands/`
   - Agent executor that manages agent chains and workflows
   - Main orchestrator that coordinates the entire system
   
2. **Core Components**:
   - `command_parser.py` - Parses slash commands and expands templates
   - `agent_executor.py` - Executes agent tasks and manages chains
   - `orchestrator.py` - Main coordinator with CLI interface
   - `claude_integration.py` - Example integration with Claude
   
3. **Features Implemented**:
   - Slash command parsing with argument support
   - Command template expansion with $ARGUMENTS placeholder
   - Task block parsing from command templates
   - Agent chain execution with context passing
   - Execution logging in chains/ directory
   - Interactive CLI mode
   - Command and agent listing
   
4. **Usage**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/don/D3/agentic
   ./agentic -i                    # Interactive mode
   ./agentic "/start-task Create login"  # Direct execution
   ./agentic --list-commands       # List commands
   ./agentic --list-agents         # List agents
   ```
   
5. **Integration Ready**:
   - System designed to work with Claude's Task tool
   - Each agent task maps to a Task tool invocation
   - Context preserved between agent executions
   - Results logged for tracking

## Status
**Completed** - The agentic development system is now functional and ready for use.
