# Task: Fix WebSocket Backend Connection Issues

**ID**: task-20250801-001803-fix-websocket-backend-connection
**Created**: 2025-08-01 00:18:03
**Status**: Active

## Description
Fix WebSocket connection failures and backend API accessibility issues in the Claude CLI Web UI. The frontend is trying to connect to localhost:8000, but the backend has been deployed to Vercel, causing connection failures.

## Issues Identified
1. **WebSocket Connection Failures**: Frontend attempting to connect to localhost:8000
2. **Backend API Inaccessibility**: 403 errors from localhost endpoints
3. **Connection Lost Errors**: Expected since local backend isn't running
4. **Backend Deployment**: User confirms backend is deployed to Vercel at https://vercel.com/bhuman/backend-vercel/deployments
5. **Error Modal Stacking**: Multiple error modals pile up, creating terrible user experience
6. **No Fallback Mechanism**: When WebSocket fails, entire app becomes unusable

## Prerequisites
Based on existing tasks:
- Task 20250731-133000: Vercel deployment completed but has authentication issues
- Task 001: Local Claude CLI Web UI is complete
- Frontend and backend both exist but connection configuration needs updating

## Progress Log
- 2025-08-01 00:18:03 - Task created for fixing WebSocket/backend connection issues
- 2025-08-01 00:18:03 - Status: Active - Beginning diagnostic and fix process
- 2025-08-01 08:07:00 - Updated task scope to include error modal stacking and fallback mechanisms

## Objective
- Update frontend configuration to connect to deployed Vercel backend instead of localhost:8000
- Fix WebSocket connection endpoint configuration
- Resolve 403 errors by updating API endpoint URLs
- Implement error modal management to prevent stacking
- Add fallback mechanisms for WebSocket failures
- Test connection to deployed backend
- Ensure WebSocket functionality works with deployed infrastructure

## Expected Outcomes
- Frontend successfully connects to Vercel-deployed backend
- WebSocket connections established and functional
- No more localhost connection errors
- Error modals properly managed (no stacking)
- Graceful fallback when WebSocket connections fail
- Real-time functionality working with deployed backend
- Updated configuration documentation
