# Task: Meta-Agent Autonomous Developer System
**ID**: task-20250801-140000-meta-agent-system
**Created**: 2025-08-01 14:00:00
**Status**: In Progress

## Description
Implement a comprehensive meta-agent autonomous developer system. The specific requirements and details need to be clarified with the user since the original request stated "implement this, do not miss any single detail" but did not specify the exact requirements for the meta-agent system.

## Progress Log
- 2025-08-01 14:00:00 - Task created, awaiting detailed requirements from user
- 2025-08-01 14:00:00 - Searched existing tasks, no meta-agent system found
- 2025-08-01 14:00:00 - Created new task directory structure

## Requirements (To Be Defined)
The user needs to specify:
1. What specific meta-agent functionality is required
2. What autonomous developer capabilities should be implemented
3. Integration requirements with existing Claude CLI Web UI system
4. Architecture preferences and constraints
5. Specific features and behaviors expected

## Outcomes
[To be updated as implementation progresses]
